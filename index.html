								<h2>The Koch Club</h2>
								<p>Koch Industries, one of the largest privately held corporations in the world and principally owned by billionaires Charles and David Koch, has developed what may be the best funded, multifaceted, public policy, political and educational presence in the nation today.</p>

								<p><b>Map: Koch-funded nonprofits</b></p>

								<p><iframe width="800" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col1+from+1a7u2tmUWl2n_EmrZ8uFdeu9JIrIw-NIo53B5BmI&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=40.329216536314505&amp;lng=-96.2646128875&amp;t=1&amp;z=5&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2"></iframe></p>

								<p>From direct political influence and robust lobbying to nonprofit policy research and advocacy, and even increasingly in academia and the broader public “marketplace of ideas,” this extensive, cross-sector Koch club or network appears to be unprecedented in size, scope and funding. And the relationship between these for-profit and nonprofit entities is often mutually reinforcing to the direct financial and political interests of the behemoth corporation — broadly characterized as deregulation, limited government and free markets.</p>

								<p>The cumulative cost to Koch Industries and Charles and David Koch for this extraordinary alchemy of political and lobbying influence, nonprofit public policy underwriting and educational institutional support was $134 million over a recent five-year period. The global conglomerate has 60,000 employees and annual revenue of $115 billion and estimated pretax profit margins of 10 percent, according to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/12/05/inside-the-koch-empire-how-the-brothers-plan-to-reshape-america/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>.</p>

								<p>An analysis by the Investigative Reporting Workshop found that from 2007 through 2011, Koch private foundations gave $41.2 million to 89 nonprofit organizations and an annual libertarian conference. Koch Industries and Charles and David Koch contributed $8.7 million to candidates and the Republican Party in the three election cycles between 2007 through 2012. In addition, Koch private foundations contributed $30.5 million to 221 U.S. colleges and universities and $46.3 million to the arts and other more traditionally charitable purposes during this period.</p>

								<p>And while Koch Industries’ lobbyists were spending $53.9 million to further the giant corporation’s federal and state policy agenda, the nonprofits it funded were simultaneously “educating” the public and lawmakers about energy, the environment and other issues in public testimony on Capitol Hill.</p>

								<p>For example, in 2011 and 2012, Koch Industries Public Sector LLC, the lobbying arm of Koch Industries, advocated for the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would have rolled back the Supreme Court’s ruling that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could regulate greenhouse gases. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and co-signed by 92 Republicans (and three Democrats), 61 of whom signed an anti-climate tax “pledge.” An economist with the American Council for Capital Formation — a nonprofit group that receives Koch money — testified about that same bill before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Margo Thorning told members of the House in February 2011 that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions “makes little economic or environmental sense,” according to her testimony.</p>

								<h2>Singing In Concert</h2>
								<p>Besides the extraordinary net worth and substantial philanthropy overall of Koch Industries’ principal owners, billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, what is it about them that makes them unusual and controversial? After all, there are millions of companies and, according to Forbes magazine, more than 1,400 billionaires in the world. The two brothers are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/list/" target="_blank">sixth in worldwide wealth</a> and tied for fourth among the wealthiest Americans, according to Forbes.</p>

								<p><img src="http://irw.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2FWordCloud_mission.png"></p>

								<p>According to the <a href="http://www.kochind.com/FactsSheets/KochFacts.aspx" target="_blank">company’s website</a>, Koch businesses extend from refining, chemicals and biofuels, to forest and consumer products, fertilizers, polymers and fibers, commodity trading and investment services, minerals and ranching.</p>

								<p>Some of its various far-flung enterprises have repeatedly violated environmental and other laws in the U.S. and around the world, and they have been fined hundreds of millions of dollars, documented most extensively by Bloomberg Markets Magazine (by Asjylyn Loder and David Evans and 14 other reporters around the world, “Koch Brothers Flout Law Getting Richer With Secret Iran Sales,” Oct. 3, 2011).</p>

								<p>For years, Charles and David Koch have aggressively exercised their constitutional rights, participating in politics through their checkbook by helping to bankroll libertarian and conservative political organizations. Most recently they have helped to underwrite the tea party political movement, as well as support a large number of Republican candidates in national and state politics. Initially more hidden, the Koch brothers have increasingly emerged into the public spotlight, especially since publication of an extensively reported article in The New Yorker about “the billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama” (by staff writer Jane Mayer, “Covert Operations,” Aug. 30, 2010, and in subsequent articles).</p>

								<p>Such discreet electoral mischief and even political maneuvering through others by the Kochs was first noticed two decades ago in Congress and elsewhere in Washington (by various news organizations, including the Center for Public Integrity in “The Buying of the President,” Avon Books/1996, pages 127-130, and since). For example, Koch Foundations contributed $19 million between 1988 and 1993 to the libertarian Cato Institute and Citizens for a Sound Economy, and with the help of a board officer of the latter organization, helped write and insert a passage in then-Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole’s regulatory reform bill. That bill would have essentially nullified a pending $54 million civil lawsuit against Koch Industries brought by the U.S. Justice Department, U.S. Customs and the Environmental Protection Agency for the company’s 300 oil spills in six states. The bill died. In 2000, Koch Industries agreed to pay a $30 million fine to the U.S. government and the state of Texas for “illegally discharged crude oil and petroleum products.”</p>

								<h2>"No Climate Tax Pledge"</h2>
								<p>Fast forward to 2011.</p>

								<p>The House of Representatives voted to slash the EPA budget by 27 percent, one of the biggest cuts since President Richard Nixon and the Congress created the agency in 1970. The Senate subsequently modified the severity of these cuts, and the budget was ultimately cut by nearly 16 percent. What is less known is that more than 100 House members — all Republicans, many tea party members — signed a little-known “pledge” (similar to the Grover Norquist no tax increase pledge) backed by the Koch brothers promising to not spend any federal money to fight climate change without an equal amount of tax cuts.</p>

								<p>Most of the pledge signers received campaign contributions from Charles or David Koch or Koch Industries. The Workshop has tracked the signing of the pledge by 411 current state and federal politicians nationwide (all Republicans except four Democrats and two Independents at the state level). Among them are such prominent state officials as Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, the Republican nominee for governor in Virginia.</p>

								<p>The first person to sign the Koch-backed pledge was Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, where Koch Industries is headquartered. Of the 85 conservative Republicans first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, 76 signed the pledge and, of those, 57 received money from Koch Industries’ political action committee. The members of Congress who signed the pledge have also introduced several bills aimed at limiting EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and limiting regulation of the nation’s biggest polluters. (For more about the “No Climate Tax Pledge,” see our related story.</p>

								<h2>Great Influence</h2>
								<p>In recent months, The New York Times and other news organizations have reported that Charles and David Koch are taking an interest in possibly buying the Tribune Media Company, which owns several major newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, Orlando Sentinel and Hartford Courant.</p>

								<p>The billionaires’ interest in journalism began in 2009 with the creation of the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity. In 2011, according to the Columbia Journalism Review, 95 percent of the center’s income came from Donors Trust, bankrolled first and foremost by the Koch-funded foundations ($3.3 million since 2008, according to IRS records). The Franklin Center has created a project called Watchdog.org, which bills itself as “a collection of independent journalists covering state-specific and local government activity.” They are based in the same office in Alexandria, Va. With 40 bureaus or “partner” organizations in 40 states, Franklin Center and Watchdog.org told CJR that they “conform to the Society of Professional Journalists standards, follow AP style and are not partisan or political.” Others, including CJR, disagree, noting that they “occasionally blur reporting and opinion and go beyond the facts of [their] findings.”</p>

								<h2>Next Generation</h2>
								<p>The Kochs have been involved in influencing higher education for more than 30 years, beginning with what is now called the Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies, both based at George Mason University in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. Between 2007 and 2011, the Kochs gave $30.5 million to 221 universities through their charitable foundations. More than half of that giving, roughly $16 million, has gone to George Mason University and its foundation. Recently, however, the Koch brothers’ influence has expanded outside Northern Virginia and created potential conflicts of interest for the universities accepting their donations.</p>

								<p>The May-June 2012 issue of Academe, the magazine of the American Association of University Professors, focused on corporate influence in higher education. Kent Miller and Ray Bellamy wrote about the Koch influence in the Florida State University economics department. The Charles G. Koch Foundation offered to give the university $1.5 million to hire two assistant professors and fund fellowships and undergraduate curriculum on free-enterprise topics. The foundation appointed an advisory board that would award money to faculty and make sure that the work they completed fit with the foundation’s mission. Miller and Bellamy wrote, “In exchange for his ‘gift,’ the donor got to assign specific readings, select speakers brought to campus and instruct them with regard to the focus of their lectures, shape the curriculum with new courses and specify the number of students in the courses, name the program’s director, and initiate a student club.”</p>

								<p>It’s not just at Florida State, which was a high-profile case, but also at other universities where the Kochs and John Allison, retired chairman and CEO of the financial institution BB&T, have donated money. Allison is on the board of directors at the Mercatus Center, which is funded by the Kochs, and following an intense fight in which the Kochs backed him, is now the president of the Cato Institute. BB&T sponsors chaired professors, typically in economics departments, and the universities where they sponsor a chaired professor often line up with where the Kochs donate.</p>

								<p>An Investigative Reporting Workshop analysis found that the Kochs had donated to 10 universities where there were BB&T-chaired professors, including West Virginia University, Clemson University and smaller universities, such as Hampden-Sydney College and Barton College. According to Inside Higher Ed in 2011, Clemson “spent several years cultivating the Charles G. Koch Foundation to support its Clemson Institute for the Study of Capitalism, and has received $1 million thus far.”</p>
